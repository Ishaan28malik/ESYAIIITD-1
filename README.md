# Problem Statement
Senior secondary education system in India

The problems we encountered: 

1. Lack of proper guidance to students for choosing future courses.
1. Students picking their streams in peer pressure.
1. Admission process.

# Our solution 
We developed a sloution which emphasizes on lowering the gap between the current curriculum of our education system and the required curriculum .
also we also tried to mentor the students in a proper way by connecting them to several mentors, who can help them to choose the right career path which will help them not to fall in peer pressure that this guy is taking that course then I will also take that course.
Plus also gives resources to get started.
